In order to fulfill increasing demands and follow regional diversity, another site was added in Bratislava, Slovakia. Only a short distance from the factory in Deutsch-Wagram, a close cooperation between these two facilities was set as a standard.</p><p>GLOCK, Inc. | Smyrna, GA - USA
GLOCK, Inc. was founded in Smyrna, Georgia in 1986 as the first subsidiary of GLOCK Ges.m.b.H. This facility began full production operations in 2013 and follows same production standards and procedures as the facilities in Austria.</p><h2 id=products>products</h2><h3 id=919mm-parabellum>9×19mm Parabellum</h3><h4 id=glock-17>Glock 17</h4><p>Glock 17: The Glock 17 is the original 9×19mm Parabellum model, with a standard magazine capacity of 17 rounds, introduced in 1982. Several modified versions of the Glock 17 have been introduced:
Glock 17L: Introduced in 1988, the 17L incorporates a longer slide and extended barrel. Initially, the Glock 17L had three holes in the top of the barrel and a corresponding slot in the slide; however, later production pistols lack the holes in the barrel. The Glock 17L is manufactured in limited quantities.
Glock 17C: Introduced in 1996, the 17C incorporates slots cut in the barrel and slide to compensate for recoil. Many other Glock pistols now come with this option, all with a &ldquo;C&rdquo; suffix on the slide.
Glock 17MB: The 17MB is a version with ambidextrous magazine catch. This model, along with the other MB variants, was no longer available upon the introduction of the fourth-generation models, which have a reversible magazine catch.
Glock 17M: Introduced in 2016, the 17M was created in response to an FBI solicitation for a new full-size 9mm pistol. Differences from the Generation 4 model include removal of the finger grooves, ambidextrous slide lock, rounded slide nose profile, flared magazine well with new magazine baseplates, and a tougher finish on metal components. The Glock 17M also abandons the polygonal rifling of previous models for conventional rifling.[80] As of 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the South Carolina Highway Patrol and the Ontario Provincial Police[81] have adopted the pistol as standard.
Glock P80: Introduced in 2020, the P80 was commissioned by United States firearms distributor Lipsey&rsquo;s to create an exclusive commemorative Glock model, the Pistole 80. The P80 is a throwback to the original Glock 17 Gen 1 type pistol chambered in 9x19mm with original Gen 1 frame and stippling and Gen 2 / Gen 3 internals.</p><h4 id=glock-18>Glock 18</h4><p>Glock 18: The Glock 18 is a selective-fire variant of the Glock 17, developed at the request of the Austrian counter-terrorist unit EKO Cobra, and as a way to internally test Glock components under high strain conditions.[82] Originally produced in 1986, this machine pistol–class firearm has a lever-type fire-control selector switch, installed on the serrated portion of the rear left side of the slide. With the selector lever in the bottom position, the pistol fires fully automatically, and with the selector lever in the top position, the pistol fires semi-automatically. The firearm is typically used with an extended 33-round-capacity magazine, although other magazines from the Glock 17 can be used, with available capacities of 10, 17, 19 or 24 rounds. Unlike all its other pistols, it is only offered to military, law enforcement, and government organizations.[83] Early Glock 18 models were ported to reduce muzzle rise during automatic fire. A very early design introduced a longer ported barrel which was soon discarded as it would not fit in a holster. Another compensated variant was produced, known as the Glock 18C. It has a keyhole opening cut into the forward portion of the slide, similar to the opening on the Glock long-slide models, although the Glock 18 has a standard-length slide. The keyhole opening provides an area to allow the four, progressively larger (from back to front) compensator cuts machined into the barrel to vent the propellant gases upwards, affording more control over the rapid-firing machine pistol.
Glock 18C: The compensator cuts start about halfway back on the top of the barrel. The two rear cuts are narrower than the two front cuts. The slide is hollowed, or dished-out, in a rectangular pattern between the rear of the ejection port and the rear sight. The rate of fire in fully automatic mode is around 1,100–1,200 rounds per minute. Most of the other characteristics are equivalent to the Glock 17, although the slide, frame, and certain fire-control parts of the Glock 18 are not interchangeable with other Glock models.[84][85]</p><h4 id=glock-19>Glock 19</h4><p>Glock 19: The Glock 19 is effectively a reduced-size Glock 17, called the &ldquo;Compact&rdquo; by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19&rsquo;s barrel and pistol grip are shorter by about 12 mm (0.5 in) than the Glock 17, and it uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, giving the Glock 19 available capacities of: 17 rounds (standard magazine with +2 extension), 10, 17, and 19 (standard Glock 17 magazine with +2), 24 and 26 (standard magazine with +2 extension) and the 31 (standard Glock 18 magazine with +2 removed) and 33 rounds of the Glock 18. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, the mass of the slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, locking block, recoil spring, guide rod, and slide lock spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19.</p><p>Glock 19X proposed by Glock Ges.m.b.H. for XM17 Modular Handgun System competition
Glock 19X: The 19X is the civilian version of Glock&rsquo;s entry to the XM17 Modular Handgun System competition for the US Military. It features a Glock 19 slide with a Glock 17 frame in coyote color instead of the regular Glock black color. The frame includes a lanyard loop and a front lip in the magazine which purpose is to make changing magazines with gloves on easier, but this means the new Gen 5 17-round magazines cannot be used in the Glock 19X because the front lip will block the extended magazine floor plates from locking into the 19X&rsquo;s magazine well. This can be remedied by switching to a Gen 4–style magazine floor plate[86] or with a factory +2 extension. The 19X comes standard with night sights and includes one 17-round magazine and two 19-round magazines, all in coyote color. The Glock 19X has proven to be one of Glock&rsquo;s best selling pistols, with over 100,000 sold within 6 months of the 19X first being released.[87]
Glock 19M: Introduced in 2016, the 19M was created in response to an FBI solicitation for a new compact 9mm pistol. Differences from the Generation 4 model include removal of the finger grooves, ambidextrous slide lock, rounded slide nose profile, flared magazine well with new magazine baseplates, and a tougher finish on metal components. The Glock 19M also abandons the polygonal rifling of previous models for conventional rifling. The US Marine Corps fielded the Glock 19M, designated as the M007, to CID (Criminal Investigation Division) and Marine One personnel.[88]
Glock 19 Canadian: The limit for Restricted Class firearms in Canada is a 105mm barrel, so, due to its 102mm barrel, the standard Glock 19 is too short to be legal. Starting in 2017, a market specific Glock 19 has been sold in Canada with a 106mm barrel and a distinctive laser-engraved hollow maple leaf on the right side of the slide.[89][90]</p><h4 id=glock-26>Glock 26</h4><p>The subcompact Glock 26 with tritium night sights in 9×19mm Parabellum
Glock 26: The Glock 26 is a 9×19mm &ldquo;subcompact&rdquo; variant designed for concealed carry and was introduced in 1995, mainly for the civilian market. It features a smaller frame compared to the Glock 19, with a pistol grip that supports only two fingers, a shorter barrel and slide, and a double-stack magazine with a standard capacity of 10 rounds. A factory magazine with a +2 extension gives a capacity of 12 rounds. In addition, factory magazines from the Glock 17, Glock 18, and Glock 19, with capacities of 15, 17, 19, 24, 31 and 33 rounds, will function in the Glock 26. More than simply a &ldquo;shortened&rdquo; Glock 19, design of the subcompact Glock 26 required extensive rework of the frame, locking block, and spring assembly that features a dual recoil spring.
Glock 26 for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP): This Glock is a Generation 5 Glock for the CBP that incorporates a flared magazine well with an extended, longer grip than that of the usual Gen 5 Glock 26. Moreover, the magazine well is flat across and has no bump as the Glock 25 Gen 5 or the G19X. In addition, it offers a Longer 11-round magazine.[91]</p><h4 id=glock-34>Glock 34</h4><p>Glock 34: The Glock 34 is a competition version of the Glock 17. It is similar to its predecessor, the Glock 17L, but with a slightly shorter slide and barrel, to meet the maximum size requirements for many sanctioned action pistol sporting events. It was developed and produced in 1998, and compared to the Glock 17, features a 21 mm (0.8 in) longer barrel and slide. It has an extended magazine release, extended slide stop lever, 20 N (4.5 lbf) trigger pull, and an adjustable rear sight. The sides at the front of the slide are slanted instead of squared. Further, the top of the slide and parts of its inside are milled out, creating a conspicuous hole at the top designed to reduce front-end muzzle weight to better balance the pistol and reduce the overall weight of the slide.[92]</p><h4 id=glock-43>Glock 43</h4><p>Glock 43: The Glock 43 is a &ldquo;slimline&rdquo; version of the subcompact Glock 26 that features an ultracompact slide and frame. The Glock 43 is the first Glock pistol to be manufactured with a single-stack 9×19mm Parabellum magazine, having a standard capacity of six rounds and being unique to the model. Unlike other subcompact Glock pistols, the Glock 43 cannot use factory magazines from its larger relatives due to its single-stack magazine design. It also does not allow the removal of the backplate grip as is possible on the 4th gen Glocks.
Glock 43X: The 43X is similar to the 43 except it has a longer and thicker grip for an increased magazine capacity of 10 rounds. The grip of the Glock 43X is comparable to the 48 and can be interchanged. Glock 43X magazines do not fit into the Glock 43, or vice versa. The 43X also features front slide serrations, a built-in extended beaver tail, a reversible magazine catch (similar to Gen 5 models), GMB rifling (again similar to Gen 5 models), and a two-tone finish (silver slide/black receiver).[93] In the E.U. the 43X comes with a rail.[94]</p><h4 id=glock-45>Glock 45</h4><p>Glock 45: The Glock 45 is a black colored version of the Glock 19X that incorporates Gen5 features catered for police use. The Glock 45 features a Glock 17 grip with a Glock 19 slide with front slide serrations. Unlike the Glock 19X, the Glock 45 features a flared magazine well like on the Gen 5 Glocks, but without the half moon cut at the front of the magazine well. The Gen 5 17-round magazines will work in the Glock 45, because unlike the 19X, the Glock 45 does not have the front lip on the magazine well that blocks the Gen 5 17-round magazine&rsquo;s extended floor plate from locking into the magazine well. The Glock 45 also deletes the lanyard loop found at the back of the grip on the 19X and comes standard with plastic sights instead of the night sights standard on the 19x.[95]</p><h4 id=glock-46>Glock 46</h4><p>Glock 46: The Glock 46 is a &ldquo;compact&rdquo; version like the Glock 19. This model has a rotating barrel breech lock system.[96] It had been designed as option to bid for a service pistol, with law enforcement agencies in Germany at state and federal level in mind. The differing breech lock system makes it possible to disassemble the firearm without the need to press the trigger, but only with no projectile chambered. Also, enhanced drop-safety is a must – the model complies with the specifications in the German technical guideline (Technische Richtlinie &ldquo;Pistole&rdquo;) for service pistols. Police in Saxony-Anhalt chose the Glock 46 TR among three competitors and are to receive up to 8,600 new pistols until 2021 for over 6,400 officers, replacing their ageing Pistole 6 (P6), a SIG Sauer P225 variant. The state of Saxony-Anhalt is the first introducing a pistol made by Glock as standard issue sidearm into its force.[97][98][99]</p><h4 id=glock-47>Glock 47</h4><p>Glock 47: The Glock 47 is a full-sized MOS version created for U.S. Customs and Border Protection that has full parts compatibility with a Glock 19, meaning a G47 slide can be put on a G19 frame to give the G19 a longer slide, barrel, and sight radius, or a G19 slide can be put on a G47 frame to create a pistol the functions like a Glock 45. The G47 also comes with magazines that have an extra extended base plate.[100] G47 and G19 Gen5/MOS/MOD1/FS have modularity between both pistols. This means that the complete upper (Slide and Barrel) from G47 can be mounted on the G19 Frame and the complete upper (Slide and Barrel) from G19 can be mounted on G47 frame.[101]</p><h4 id=glock-48>Glock 48</h4><p>Glock 48: The Glock 48 is a &ldquo;slimline&rdquo; version similar to the subcompact Glock 43 and 43X. All components of the Glock 48 are identical to the Glock 43X except the slide and barrel which are longer. The slides for the Glock 43, Glock 43X, and Glock 48 are functional on any of those three frames. The G48 features a 4.17-inch-long barrel, front slide serrations, a built-in extended beaver tail, a reversible magazine catch (similar to Gen 5 models), GMB rifling (again similar to Gen 5 models), a two-tone finish (silver slide/black receiver), and a magazine capacity of 10 rounds.[94] In the E.U. Glock offers the 48 and the 43X with a rail.[94]</p><h3 id=921mm>9×21mm</h3><p>Rare within the United States, a Glock 17 chambered in 9×21mm
The 9×21mm pistol cartridge was adopted and commercialized by Israel Military Industries for those markets (such as in France, Italy, and Mexico) where military service cartridges like the 9×19mm Parabellum, are banned by law for civilian use. Glock produces the Model 17, and other models,[102] chambered in 9×21mm for these markets; however, Glock does not export or produce the 9×21mm pistols for the United States commercial market. This makes any 9×21mm Glock model a unique and highly desirable item for US firearm collectors. A limited number of 9×21mm Glocks have been imported to the US and are mostly held by collectors and gun enthusiasts.[103]
10mm Auto</p><p>The subcompact third-generation Glock 29 in 10mm Auto</p><p>Glock 20: The Glock 20, introduced in 1991, was developed for the then-growing law enforcement and security forces market for the 10mm Auto. The pistol handles both full-power and reduced &ldquo;FBI&rdquo; loads that have reduced muzzle velocity. Due to the longer cartridge and higher pressures, the pistol is slightly larger than the Glock 17, having a roughly 2.5 mm (0.1 in) greater width and 7 mm (0.3 in) greater length. Though many small parts interchange with the Glock 17, with a close to 50% parts commonality, the major assemblies are scaled-up and do not interchange. The standard magazine capacity of the Glock 20 is 15 rounds. In 2009, Glock announced they would offer a 152 mm (6.0 in) barrel as a drop-in option.[104]
Glock 20SF: The 20SF is a version of the Glock 20 that uses the Short Frame (SF) which is based on the standard G20 frame (same width), but reduces the trigger reach from the back of the grip by 2.5 mm (0.098 in) and the heel of the pistol is shortened by 4 mm (0.16 in) so the trigger can be reached and operated better by users with relatively small hands.
Glock 29: The Glock 29 is a 10mm Auto equivalent of the subcompact Glock 26 introduced in 1997 along with the Glock 30 (.45 ACP). The pistol features a 96 mm (3.8 in) barrel and a standard magazine capacity of 10 rounds. Like other subcompact Glock pistols, the Glock 29 functions with the factory magazines from its related full-size model, giving an optional capacity of 15 rounds.
Glock 29SF: The 29SF version of the Glock 29 uses the SF which is based on the standard G29 frame (same width), but reduces the trigger reach from the back of the grip by 2.5 mm (0.098 in).
Glock 40: The Glock 40, introduced in 2015, is a 10mm Auto equivalent of the long-slide Glock 17L. The Glock 40 is only made with the &ldquo;Gen4&rdquo; frame and &ldquo;MOS&rdquo; (Modular Optic System) configuration.[105]</p><h3 id=45-acp>.45 ACP</h3><p>The slim-frame Glock 36 in .45 ACP
Glock pistols chambered for the .45 ACP (and the .45 GAP) feature octagonal polygonal rifling rather than the hexagonal-shaped bores used for models in most other chamberings.[106] Octagonal rifling provides a better gas seal in relatively large diameter rifled bores, since an octagon resembles a circle more closely than a hexagon.[67]</p><p>Glock 21: The Glock 21 is a .45 ACP version of the Glock 20 designed primarily for the American market.[107] Compared to the Glock 20 chambered in 10mm Auto, the slide of the Glock 21 is lighter to compensate for the lower-energy .45 ACP cartridge. The standard Glock 21 magazine is of the single-position-feed, staggered-column type with a capacity of 13 rounds.
Glock 21SF: The 21SF is a version of the Glock 21 that uses a Short Frame lower which is based on the standard G21 frame (same width), but reduces trigger reach from the back of the grip by 2.5 mm (0.098 in), and the heel of the pistol is shortened by 4 mm (0.16 in) so the trigger can be reached and operated better by users with smaller hands.
Glock 30: The Glock 30 is a .45 ACP version of the subcompact Glock 29, with a standard magazine capacity of 10 rounds. The factory magazine from the Glock 21, with a capacity of 13 rounds, will function in the Glock 30.
Glock 30SF: The 30SF is a version of the Glock 30 that uses a Short Frame lower which is based on the standard G30 frame (same width), but reduces trigger reach from the back of the grip by 2.5 mm (0.098 in). The G30SF accepts the same double-stack .45ACP magazines as the G30 and G21.[108]
Glock 30S: The 30S is a version of the Glock 30 that features a thin slide (same slide as the G36), a Short Frame lower, and a double stack magazine.[109] Like the G30, G30S magazines holds 10 rounds.[110]
Glock 36: The Glock 36 is a &ldquo;slimline&rdquo; version of the subcompact Glock 30 that features an ultracompact slide and frame and is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. The Glock 36 is the first Glock pistol to be manufactured with a single-stack magazine, having a standard capacity of six rounds and being unique to the model. The Glock 36 cannot use factory magazines from its larger relatives due to its single-stack magazine design.
Glock 41: The Glock 41 is a competition version of the Glock 21, much like what the G34 is in relation to the G17; it features a 5.3-inch barrel and an elongated slide. The Glock 41 is only made with the &ldquo;Gen4&rdquo; frame.[111]</p><h3 id=40-sw>.40 S&W</h3><p>Glock 22 OD in .40 S&W with Coyote Brown frame</p><p>The competition-oriented Glock 35 in .40 S&W
Glock 22: The Glock 22 is a .40 S&W version of the full-sized Glock 17 introduced in 1990. The pistol uses a modified slide, frame, and barrel to account for the differences in size and power of the .40 S&W cartridge. The standard magazine capacity is 15 rounds. The Glock Model 22 is favored and used by multiple law enforcement agencies around the world, including the Baltimore Police Department, Los Angeles Police Department, Miami Police Department, Maryland State Police, Overland Park Police Department, Kansas City Police Department, Missouri State Highway Patrol, and Alaska State Troopers in the United States; the NSW Police Force and Queensland Police Service in Australia; the Edmonton Police Service, Calgary Police Service, Alberta Sheriffs Branch, Winnipeg Police Service, Toronto Police Service, Ottawa Police Service, and British Columbia Sheriff Service in Canada; and the National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines), among others.
Glock 23: The Glock 23 is a .40 S&W version of the compact Glock 19. It is dimensionally identical to the Glock 19, but is slightly heavier and uses a modified slide, frame, .40 S&W barrel, and a standard magazine capacity of 13 rounds. The factory 15-round magazine from the larger Glock 22 will function in the Glock 23.
Glock 24: The Glock 24 is a .40 S&W long-slide variant of the Glock 22, similar in concept to the Glock 17L. Additionally, a compensated, ported-barrel version designated the 24C was also produced. The Glock 24 was introduced in 1994 and officially dropped from the company&rsquo;s regular product lineup upon the release of the Glock 34 and 35.[112]
Glock 27: The Glock 27 is a .40 S&W version of the subcompact Glock 26, with a standard magazine capacity of 9 rounds. The factory magazines from the larger Glock 22 and 23 will function in the Glock 27, increasing capacity to 13 or 15 rounds. Spacers are available that fit on these larger-capacity magazines themselves; they have the effect of &ldquo;extending&rdquo; the magazine well of the pistol, thereby improving the ergonomic feel of the pistol when the longer magazines are inserted.
Glock 35: The Glock 35 is a .40 S&W version of the competition Glock 34. The Glock Model 35 was the service pistol for the Kentucky State Police, but by the summer of 2017, they had reverted from the Glock 35 back to 9mm weapons because of improvements in 9mm bullets, making them superior to the Glock 35&rsquo;s .40 ammunition in performance and economy as measured in the standard &ldquo;FBI Protocol&rdquo; tests.[113]
As is typical of pistols chambered in .40 S&W, each of the standard Glock models (22, 23, and 27) may be easily converted to the corresponding .357 SIG chambering (Glock 31, 32, and 33, respectively) simply by replacing the barrel. No other parts need to be replaced, as the .40 S&W magazines will feed the .357 SIG rounds.</p><h3 id=380-acp>.380 ACP</h3><p>The first two .380 ACP models are primarily intended for markets that prohibit civilian ownership of firearms chambered in military calibers such as 9×19mm Parabellum.[114] Despite this, they are legally prohibited from being sold to civilians in the United States due to being manufactured in Austria and not meeting the import restrictions based on their caliber.[115] They are also prohibited from ownership in Canada due to not meeting minimum barrel length requirements for handguns.</p><p>Due to the relatively low bolt thrust of the .380 ACP cartridge, the locked-breech design of the Glock 19 and Glock 26 was minimally modified for the Glock 25 and Glock 28 to implement unlocked breech operation. It operates via straight blowback of the slide. This required modification of the locking surfaces on the barrel, as well as a redesign of the former locking block. Unusual for a blowback design, the barrel is not fixed to the frame. It moves rearward in recoil until it is tilted below the slide, similar to the standard locked-breech system. The reduced size and mass of the Glock 42 required return to the Glock-standard locked-breech design.</p><p>Glock 25: The Glock 25 , introduced in 1995, is a blowback derivative of the compact (102 mm (4.0 in) barrel) Glock 19. The magazine capacity is 15 rounds. Standard fixed sight elevation is 6.9 mm, unlike the 6.5 mm elevation used for the 9×19mm models.[116]
Glock 28: The Glock 28 , introduced in 1997, is a blowback derivative of the subcompact (87 mm (3.4 in) barrel) Glock 26. The standard magazine capacity is 10 rounds, but the 15-round Glock 25 magazine will function in the Glock 28. Standard fixed-sight elevation is 6.9 mm, unlike the 6.5 mm elevation used for the 9×19mm Parabellum models.
Glock 42: The Glock 42 , introduced in 2014, is an all-new locked-breech &ldquo;slimline&rdquo; (83 mm (3.3 in) barrel) design. The single-stack magazine is unique to this model, with a capacity of six rounds. It is Glock&rsquo;s smallest model ever made and is manufactured in the US, which unlike the Glock 25 and 28, allows domestic sales in that market.</p><h3 id=357-sig>.357 SIG</h3><p>The subcompact Glock 33 in .357 SIG
Glock 31: The Glock 31 is a .357 SIG variant of the full-sized Glock 22. The standard magazine capacity of the Glock 31 is 15 rounds.
Glock 32: The Glock 32 is a .357 SIG variant of the compact Glock 23. The standard magazine capacity of the Glock 32 is 13 rounds.
Glock 33: The Glock 33 is a .357 SIG variant of the subcompact Glock 27. The standard magazine capacity of the Glock 33 is 9 rounds.
As is typical of pistols chambered in .357 SIG, each of the standard Glock models (31, 32, and 33) may be easily converted to the corresponding .40 S&W chambering (Glock 22, 23, and 27, respectively) simply by replacing the barrel. No other parts need to be replaced, as the .357 SIG magazines will feed the .40 S&W round.</p><h3 id=45-gap>.45 GAP</h3><p>Glock pistols chambered for the .45 GAP (and the .45 ACP) feature octagonal polygonal rifling rather than the hexagonal-shaped bores used for models in most other chamberings.[106] Octagonal rifling provides a better gas seal in relatively large diameter rifled bores, since an octagon will have shorter sides and shallower angles than a hexagon.[67]</p><p>Glock 37: The Glock 37 is a .45 GAP version of the Glock 17. It uses a wider, beveled slide, larger barrel, and different magazine, but is otherwise similar to the Glock 17. The Glock 37 first appeared in 2003. It was designed to offer ballistic performance comparable with the .45 ACP in the frame size of the Glock 17. The concern with the size of the Glock 20/21 has been addressed by the Glock 36, 21SF, and 30SF, all of which featured reduced-size frames. The standard magazine capacity of the Glock 37 is 10 rounds.
Glock 38: The Glock 38 is a .45 GAP version of the compact Glock 19.[117] The standard magazine capacity of the Glock 38 is 8 rounds.
Glock 39: The Glock 39 is a .45 GAP version of the subcompact Glock 26. The standard magazine capacity of the Glock 39 is 6 rounds.</p><h3 id=22-lr>.22 LR</h3><p>Glock 44: The Glock 44 is a .22 LR (Long Rifle) rimfire model based on the Glock 19. While the Glock 44 is similar in size as the Glock 19, the Glock 44 has a magazine capacity of 10 rounds and uses a simple blow-back mechanism instead of a locked breech mechanism used on nearly all other Glock pistols.[118] In addition, the Glock 44 is lighter than the G19, weighing in at just 12 ounces. And it retains Glock&rsquo;s popular polygonal rifling, which has been tested by Glock to work with lead .22 bullets. It uses a steel/polymer composite slide due to the lower slide weight needed for blowback.[119]</p></div><div class=mt-5></div></div></div></div></section></div><footer id=footer class=section-bg><div class=container><div class="row wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration=500ms><div class=col-xl-12><div class=social-icon><ul class=list-inline><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://www.facebook.com/scutum.life><i class=ti-facebook></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://twitter.com/scutum_life><i class=ti-twitter-alt></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClxTh26FwmYXXi67IXoJVJw><i class=ti-youtube></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://www.instagram.com/scutum.life/><i class=ti-instagram></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="copyright text-center"><a href=https://scutum.life/><img src=https://scutum.life/images/logo.png alt="Scutum - Lifesafety Education Center" height=42></a><br><p>Copyright © 2022, Scutum</p></div></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://scutum.life/plugins/jquery/jquery.min.js></script>
