A firearm is a [[gun barrel|barreled]] [[ranged weapon]] that inflicts damage on targets by launching one or more [[projectile]]s driven by rapidly expanding high-pressure gas produced by [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] combustion ([[deflagration]]) of a chemical [[propellant]], historically [[black powder]], now [[smokeless powder]].<ref name=Cole><ref name=Merriam-webster.com><ref name=Firearm></p><p>In the military, firearms are categorized into &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; and &ldquo;light&rdquo; weapons regarding their portability by [[foot soldier]]s. Light firearms are those that can be readily carried by individual [[infantry]], though they might still require more than one individual ([[crew-served weapon|crew-served]]) to achieve optimal operational capacity. Heavy firearms are those that are too large and heavy to be transported on foot, or too unstable against [[recoil]] and thus require the support of a [[weapons platform]] (e.g. a [[weapon mount#Static mount|fixed mount]], [[gun carriage|wheeled carriage]], [[vehicle]], [[aircraft]] or [[water vessel]]) to be tactically [[mobility (military)|mobile]] or useful.</p><p>The [[subset]] of light firearms that only use [[projectile#Kinetic projectiles|kinetic projectile]]s and are compact enough to be operated to full capacity by a single infantryman (individual-served) are also referred to as &ldquo;small arms&rdquo;.

Handguns are guns that can be used with a single hand, and are the smallest of all firearms. However, the legal definition of a &ldquo;handgun&rdquo; varies between countries and regions. For example, in South African law, a &ldquo;handgun&rdquo; means a pistol or revolver which can be held in and discharged with one hand.<ref name=act60of2000> In Australia, the gun law considers a handgun as a firearm carry-able or concealable about the person; or capable of being raised and fired by one hand; or not exceeding {{cvt|65|cm|in}}.<ref name=www5.austlii.edu.au>{{cite web|url=http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/fa1996102/s3.html|title=FIREARMS ACT 1996 - SECT 3 Definitions|access-date=2020-03-07|archive-date=2020-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612093619/http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/fa1996102/s3.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In the United States, [[Title 18 of the United States Code|Title 18]] and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] considers a handgun as a firearm which has a short [[buttstock|stock]] and is designed to be held and fired by the use of a single hand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2018-title18/html/USCODE-2018-title18-partI-chap44-sec921.htm|title=U.S.C.

Revolvers have a number of firing chambers or &ldquo;charge holes&rdquo; in a revolving cylinder; each chamber in the cylinder is loaded with a single [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] or charge. Semi-automatic pistols have a single fixed firing-chamber machined into the rear of the barrel, and a magazine so they can be used to fire more than one round. Each press of the trigger fires a cartridge, using the energy of the cartridge to activate a mechanism so that the next cartridge may be fired immediately. This is opposed to &ldquo;[[double-action]]&rdquo; revolvers, which accomplish the same end using a mechanical action linked to the trigger pull.</p><p>With the invention of the revolver in 1818, handguns capable of holding multiple rounds became popular. Certain designs of auto-loading pistol appeared beginning in the 1870s and had largely supplanted revolvers in military applications by the end of World War I. By the end of the 20th century, most handguns carried regularly by military, police and civilians were semi-automatic, although revolvers were still widely used. Generally speaking, military and police forces use semi-automatic pistols due to their high magazine capacities and ability to rapidly reload by simply removing the empty magazine and inserting a loaded one. Revolvers are very common among handgun hunters because revolver cartridges are usually more powerful than similar caliber semi-automatic pistol cartridges (which are designed for [[self-defense]]) and the strength, simplicity and durability of the revolver design is well-suited to outdoor use. Revolvers, especially in [[.22 LR]] and 38 Special/357 Magnum, are also common [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed weapons]] in jurisdictions allowing this practice because their simple mechanics make them smaller than many autoloaders while remaining reliable. Both designs are common among civilian gun owners, depending on the owner&rsquo;s intention (self-defense, hunting, target shooting, competitions, collecting, etc.).</p><h4 id=long-guns>Long guns</h4><p>{{main|Long gun}}
A long gun is any firearm with a notably long barrel, typically a length of {{convert|10|to|30|in|mm}} (there are restrictions on minimum barrel length in many jurisdictions; maximum barrel length is usually a matter of practicality). Unlike a handgun, long guns are designed to be held and fired with both hands, while braced against either the hip or the shoulder for better stability. The receiver and trigger group is mounted into a stock made of wood, plastic, metal, or composite material, which has sections that form a foregrip, rear grip, and optionally (but typically) a shoulder mount called the &lsquo;&lsquo;butt&rsquo;&rsquo;. Early long arms, from the Renaissance up to the mid-19th century, were generally smoothbore firearms that fired one or more ball shot, called [[musket]]s or [[arquebus]] depending on caliber and firing mechanism.</p><h5 id=rifles-and-shotguns>Rifles and shotguns</h5><p>{{main|Rifle|Shotgun}}
[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Springfield Armory]] [[M1903 Springfield|M1903 rifle]]]]
Most modern long guns are either [[rifle]]s or [[shotgun]]s. Both are the successors of the musket, diverging from their parent weapon in distinct ways. A rifle is so named for the spiral grooves ([[rifling]]s) machined into the inner (bore) surface of its barrel, which imparts a gyroscopically-stabilizing spin to the [[bullet]]s that it fires. Shotguns are predominantly [[smoothbore]] firearms designed to fire a number of &lsquo;&rsquo;[[shot (pellet)|shot]]&rsquo;&rsquo; in each discharge; pellet sizes commonly ranging between 2 mm #9 birdshot and 8.4 mm #00 (double-aught) buckshot. Shotguns are also capable of firing single solid projectiles called [[shotgun slug|slugs]], or specialty (often &ldquo;[[Non-lethal weapon|less lethal]]&rdquo;) rounds such as [[Bean bag round|bean bags]], [[tear gas]] or [[breaching round]]s. Rifles produce a single point of impact with each firing but a long range and high accuracy; while shotguns produce a cluster of impact points with considerably less range and accuracy. However, the larger impact area of shotguns can compensate for reduced accuracy, since [[shotgun shell#Spread|shot spreads]] during flight; consequently, in hunting, shotguns are generally used for fast-flying game birds.</p><p>Rifles and shotguns are commonly used for hunting and often also for [[home defense]], [[security guard]] and [[law enforcement]]. Usually, large game are hunted with rifles (although shotguns can be used, particularly with slugs), while birds are hunted with shotguns. Shotguns are sometimes preferred for defending a home or business due to their wide impact area, multiple wound tracks (when using buckshot), shorter range, and reduced penetration of walls (when using lighter shot), which significantly reduces the likelihood of unintended harm, although the handgun is also common.</p><p>[[File:3-7 Shooting Competition (Image 2 of 4) (12753731154).jpg|thumb|left|A [[United States Marine|US Marine]] firing a [[Mossberg 500]] shotgun]]
There are a variety of types of rifles and shotguns based on the method in which they are reloaded. Bolt-action and lever-action rifles are manually operated. Manipulation of the bolt or the lever causes the spent cartridge to be removed, the firing mechanism recocked, and a fresh cartridge inserted. These two types of action are almost exclusively used by rifles. Slide-action (commonly called &lsquo;pump-action&rsquo;) rifles and shotguns are manually cycled by shuttling the foregrip of the firearm back and forth. This type of action is typically used by shotguns, but several major manufacturers make rifles that use this action.</p><p>Both rifles and shotguns also come in break-action varieties that do not have any kind of reloading mechanism at all but must be hand-loaded after each shot. Both rifles and shotguns come in single- and double-barreled varieties; however, due to the expense and difficulty of manufacturing, double-barreled rifles are rare. Double-barreled rifles are typically intended for African big-game hunts where the animals are dangerous, ranges are short, and speed is of the essence. Very large and powerful calibers are normal for these firearms.</p><p>Rifles have been in nationally featured marksmanship events in Europe and the United States since at least the 18th century, when rifles were first becoming widely available. One of the earliest purely &ldquo;American&rdquo; rifle-shooting competitions took place in 1775, when Daniel Morgan was recruiting sharpshooters in Virginia for the impending [[American Revolutionary War]]. In some countries, rifle marksmanship is still a matter of national pride. Some specialized rifles in the larger calibers are claimed to have an accurate range of up to about {{convert|1|mi|m}}, although most have considerably less. In the second half of the 20th century, competitive shotgun sports became perhaps even more popular than riflery, largely due to the motion and immediate feedback in activities such as skeet, trap and sporting clays.</p><p>In military use, bolt-action rifles with high-power scopes are common as sniper rifles, however by the [[Korean War]] the traditional bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles used by infantrymen had been supplemented by select-fire designs known as [[automatic rifle]]s.</p><h5 id=carbines>Carbines</h5><p>{{main|Carbine}}
A carbine is a firearm similar to a rifle in form and intended usage, but generally shorter or smaller than the typical &ldquo;full-size&rdquo; hunting or battle rifle of a similar time period, and sometimes using a smaller or less-powerful cartridge. Carbines were and are typically used by members of the military in roles that are expected to engage in combat, but where a full-size rifle would be an impediment to the primary duties of that soldier (vehicle drivers, field commanders and support staff, airborne troops, engineers, etc.). Carbines are also common in law enforcement and among civilian owners where similar size, space and/or power concerns may exist. Carbines, like rifles, can be single-shot, repeating-action, semi-automatic or select-fire/fully automatic, generally depending on the time period and intended market. Common historical examples include the [[Winchester Model 1892]], Lee–Enfield &ldquo;[[Jungle Carbine]]&rdquo;, [[SKS]], [[M1 carbine]] (no relation to the larger [[M1 Garand]]) and [[M4 carbine]] (a more compact variant of the current [[M16 rifle]]). Modern U.S. civilian carbines include compact customizations of the [[AR-15]], [[Ruger Mini-14]], [[Beretta Cx4 Storm]], [[Kel-Tec SUB-2000]], bolt-action rifles generally falling under the specifications of a [[scout rifle]], and aftermarket conversion kits for popular pistols including the [[M1911 pistol|M1911]] and [[Glock]] models.</p><h5 id=machine-guns>Machine guns</h5><p>{{main|Machine gun}}
[[File:MG42 Sideview.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[MG 42]] general-purpose machine gun with retracted [[bipod]]]]
A machine gun is a fully [[automatic firearm]], most often separated from other classes of automatic weapons by the use of belt-fed ammunition (though some designs employ drum, pan or hopper magazines), generally in a rifle-inspired caliber ranging between [[5.56×45mm NATO]] (.223 Remington) for a [[light machine gun]] to as large as [[.50 BMG]] or even larger for crewed or aircraft weapons. Although not widely fielded until World War I, early machine guns were being used by militaries in the second half of the 19th century. Notables in the U.S. arsenal during the 20th century included the [[M2 Browning]] .50 caliber heavy machine gun, [[M1919 Browning machine gun|M1919 Browning]] .30 caliber medium machine gun, and the [[M60 machine gun|M60]] [[7.62×51mm NATO]] general-purpose machine gun which came into use around the Vietnam War. Machine guns of this type were originally defensive firearms crewed by at least two men, mainly because of the difficulties involved in moving and placing them, their ammunition, and their tripod. In contrast, modern [[light machine gun]]s such as the [[FN Minimi]] are often wielded by a single infantryman. They provide a large ammunition capacity and a high rate of fire, and are typically used to give suppressing fire during infantry movement. Accuracy on machine guns varies based on a wide number of factors from design to manufacturing tolerances, most of which have been improved over time. Machine guns are often mounted on vehicles or helicopters and have been used since World War I as offensive firearms in fighter aircraft and tanks (e.g. for air combat or suppressing fire for ground troop support).</p><p>The definition of a machine gun is different in U.S. law. The [[National Firearms Act]] and [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] define a &ldquo;machine gun&rdquo; in the United States code &lsquo;&lsquo;Title 26, Subtitle E, Chapter 53, Subchapter B, Part 1, § 5845&rsquo;&rsquo; as:
&ldquo;&mldr; any firearm which shoots &mldr; automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger&rdquo;. &ldquo;Machine gun&rdquo; is therefore largely synonymous with &ldquo;automatic weapon&rdquo; in the U.S. civilian parlance, covering all automatic firearms.</p><h5 id=sniper-rifles>Sniper rifles</h5><p>{{main|Sniper rifle}}
[[File:G22 ohne Schalldaempfer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare]] series of sniper rifles is a standard issue in the armies of several countries, including those of Britain, Ireland, and [[German Army|Germany]] (shown).]]
The definition of a sniper rifle is disputed among military, police and civilian observers alike, however most generally define a “sniper rifle” as a high powered, semi-automatic/bolt action, precision rifle with an accurate range further than that of a standard rifle. These are often purpose-built for their applications. For example, a police sniper rifle may differ in specs from a military rifle. Police snipers generally do not engage targets at extreme range, but rather, a target at medium range. They may also have multiple targets within the shorter range, and thus a semi-automatic model is preferred to a bolt action. They also may be more compact than mil-spec rifles as police marksmen may need more portability. On the other hand, a military rifle is more likely to use a higher-powered cartridge to defeat body armor or medium-light cover. They are more commonly (but not a lot more) bolt-action, as they are simpler to build and maintain. Also, due to fewer moving and overall parts, they are much more reliable under adverse conditions. They may also have a more powerful scope to acquire targets further away. Overall, sniper units never became prominent until [[World War I]], when the Germans displayed their usefulness on the battlefield. Since then, they have become irrevocably embedded in warfare. Examples of sniper rifles include the [[Accuracy International AWM]], [[Sako TRG-42]] and the [[CheyTac M200]]. Examples of specialized sniper cartridges include the [[.338 Lapua Magnum]], [[.300 Winchester Magnum]], and [[.408 CheyTac]] rounds.</p><h5 id=submachine-guns>Submachine guns</h5><p>{{main|Submachine gun}}
[[File:Skorpion PICT0107.jpg|thumb|right|Czechoslovak 7.65 mm [[submachine gun]] [[Škorpion vz. 61]] designed in 1959.]]</p><p>A submachine gun is a magazine-fed firearm, usually smaller than other automatic firearms, that fires [[pistol]]-caliber ammunition; for this reason certain submachine guns can also be referred to as &lsquo;&lsquo;machine pistols&rsquo;&rsquo;, especially when referring to handgun-sized designs such as the [[Škorpion vz. 61]] and [[Glock#9×19mm Parabellum|Glock 18]]. Well-known examples are the Israeli [[Uzi]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] which use the [[9×19mm Parabellum]] cartridge, and the American [[Thompson submachine gun]] which fires [[.45 ACP]]. Because of their small size and limited projectile penetration compared to high-power rifle rounds, submachine guns are commonly favored by military, paramilitary and police forces for close-quarters engagements such as inside buildings, in urban areas or in trench complexes.</p><p>[[File:Suomi M31 Torpin Tykit 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Suomi KP/-31|Suomi M31]] submachine with a 70-round drum magazine attached, 20- and 50-round box magazines.]]
Submachine guns were originally about the size of carbines. Because they fire pistol ammunition, they have limited long-range use, but in close combat can be used in fully automatic in a controllable manner due to the lighter recoil of the pistol ammunition. They are also extremely inexpensive and simple to build in time of war, enabling a nation to quickly arm its military. In the latter half of the 20th century, submachine guns were being miniaturized to the point of being only slightly larger than some large handguns. The most widely used submachine gun at the end of the 20th century was the Heckler & Koch MP5. The MP5 is actually designated as a &ldquo;machine pistol&rdquo; by Heckler & Koch (MP5 stands for &lsquo;&lsquo;Maschinenpistole 5&rsquo;&rsquo;, or Machine Pistol 5), although some reserve this designation for even smaller submachine guns such as the MAC-10 and [[Glock#9×19mm Parabellum|Glock 18]], which are about the size and shape of pistols.</p><h5 id=automatic-rifles>Automatic rifles</h5><p>{{main|Automatic rifle}}
An automatic rifle is a magazine-fed firearm, wielded by a single infantryman, that is chambered for rifle cartridges and capable of automatic fire. The [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]] was the first U.S. infantry weapon of this type, and was generally used for suppressive or support fire in the role now usually filled by the [[light machine gun]]. Other early automatic rifles include the [[Fedorov Avtomat]] and the [[Huot Automatic Rifle]]. Later, German forces fielded the [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]] during [[World War II]], a light automatic rifle firing a reduced power &ldquo;[[intermediate cartridge]]&rdquo;. This design was to become the basis for the &ldquo;[[assault rifle]]&rdquo; subclass of automatic weapons, as contrasted with &ldquo;[[battle rifle]]s&rdquo;, which generally fire a traditional &ldquo;full-power&rdquo; rifle cartridge.</p><h5 id=assault-rifles>Assault rifles</h5><p>{{main|Assault rifle}}
[[File:AK-47 assault rifle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[AK-47]] is one of the most widely produced and used [[assault rifle]]s in the world.]]
In [[World War II]], Germany introduced the [[StG 44]], and brought to the forefront of firearm technology what eventually became the class of firearm most widely adopted by the military, the assault rifle. An assault rifle is usually slightly smaller than a [[battle rifle]] such as the American M14, but the chief differences defining an assault rifle are [[Selective fire|select-fire capability]] and the use of a rifle round of lesser power, known as an [[intermediate cartridge]].</p><p>Soviet engineer [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] quickly adapted the German concept, using a less-powerful 7.62×39mm cartridge derived from the standard 7.62×54mmR Russian battle rifle round, to produce the [[AK-47]], which has become the world&rsquo;s most widely used assault rifle. Soon after World War II, the Automatic Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle began to be fielded by the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies in the Eastern Bloc, as well as by nations such as China, North Korea, and North Vietnam.</p><p>In the United States, the assault rifle design was later in coming; the replacement for the M1 Garand of WWII was another John Garand design chambered for the new [[7.62×51mm NATO]] cartridge; the select-fire [[M14 rifle|M14]], which was used by the U.S. military until the 1960s. The significant recoil of the M14 when fired in full-automatic mode was seen as a problem as it reduced accuracy, and in the 1960s it was replaced by [[Eugene Stoner]]&rsquo;s [[AR-15]], which also marked a switch from the powerful .30 caliber cartridges used by the U.S. military up until early in the Vietnam War to the much less powerful but far lighter and light recoiling .223 caliber (5.56mm) [[intermediate cartridge]]. The military later designated the AR-15 as the &ldquo;[[M16 rifle|M16]]&rdquo;. The civilian version of the M16 continues to be known as the AR-15 and looks exactly like the military version, although to conform to [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] regulations in the U.S., it lacks the mechanism that permits fully automatic fire.</p><p>Variants of both of the M16 and AK-47 are still in wide international use today, though other automatic rifle designs have since been introduced. A smaller version of the M16A2, the [[M4 carbine]], is widely used by U.S. and NATO tank and vehicle crews, airbornes, support staff, and in other scenarios where space is limited. The [[IMI Galil]], an Israeli-designed weapon based on the action of the AK-47, is in use by Israel, Italy, Burma, the Philippines, Peru, and Colombia. [[Swiss Arms]] of Switzerland produces the [[SIG SG 550]] assault rifle used by France, Chile, and Spain among others, and [[Steyr Mannlicher]] produces the [[Steyr AUG|AUG]], a [[bullpup]] rifle in use in Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Saudi Arabia among other nations.</p><p>Modern designs call for compact weapons retaining firepower. The bullpup design, by mounting the magazine behind the trigger, unifies the accuracy and firepower of the traditional assault rifle with the compact size of the submachine gun (though submachine guns are still used); examples are the French [[FAMAS]] and the British [[SA80]].</p><h5 id=personal-defense-weapons>Personal defense weapons</h5><p>{{main|Personal defense weapon}}
[[File:FN P90 PDW.jpg|thumb|[[FN P90]] PDW]]
A recently developed class of firearm is the [[personal defense weapon]] or PDW, which is in simplest terms a [[submachine gun]] designed to fire ammunitions with ballistic performance similar to rifle cartridges. While a submachine gun is desirable for its compact size and ammunition capacity, its pistol cartridges lack the penetrating capability of a rifle round. Conversely, rifle bullets can pierce light armor and are easier to shoot accurately, but even a [[carbine]] such as the Colt M4 is larger and/or longer than a submachine gun, making it harder to maneuver in close quarters. The solution many firearms manufacturers have presented is a weapon resembling a submachine gun in size and general configuration, but which fires a higher-powered armor-penetrating round (often specially designed for the weapon), thus combining the advantages of a carbine and submachine gun. This also earned the PDWs an infrequently used nickname — the submachine carbines. The [[FN P90]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP7]] are most famous examples of PDWs.</p><h5 id=battle-rifles>Battle rifles</h5><p>{{main|Battle rifle}}</p><p>[[File:Scar H Standard.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Belgium|Belgian]] [[FN SCAR#SCAR-H|FN SCAR-H]]]]</p><p>Battle rifles are another subtype of rifle, usually defined as [[selective fire]] rifles that use full power rifle cartridges, examples of which include the [[7.62x51mm NATO]], [[7.92x57mm Mauser]], and [[7.62x54mmR]]. These serve similar purposes as assault rifles, as they both are usually employed by ground infantry. However, some prefer battle rifles due to their more powerful cartridge, despite added recoil. Some semi-automatic sniper rifles are configured from battle rifles.</p><h3 id=function>Function</h3><p>{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}

Firearms are also categorized by their functioning cycle or &ldquo;action&rdquo; which describes its loading, firing, and unloading cycle.</p><h4 id=manual>Manual</h4><p>The earliest evolution of the firearm, there are many types of manual action firearms. These can be divided into two basic categories: [[single shot]] and [[Repeating rifle|repeating]].</p><p>A single shot firearm can only be fired once per equipped barrel before it must be reloaded or charged via an external mechanism or series of steps. A repeating firearm can be fired multiple times, but can only be fired once with each subsequent pull of the trigger. Between trigger pulls, the firearm&rsquo;s action must be reloaded or charged via an internal mechanism.</p><h4 id=lever-action>Lever action</h4><p>A gun which has a lever that is pulled down then back up to expel the old cartridge then load a new round.</p><h4 id=pump-action>Pump action</h4><p>Pump action weapons are primarily shotguns. A pump action is created when the user slides a lever (usually a grip) and it brings a new round in the chamber while expelling the old one.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pump-action | title=Definition of PUMP-ACTION | access-date=2020-01-04 | archive-date=2021-01-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118200826/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pump-action | url-status=live }}</ref></p><h4 id=semi-automatic>Semi-automatic</h4><p>{{main|Semi-automatic firearm}}
A semi-automatic, self-loading, or &ldquo;auto loader&rdquo; firearm is one that performs all steps necessary to prepare it for firing again after a single discharge, until cartridges are no longer available in the weapon&rsquo;s feed device or magazine. Auto loaders fire one round with each pull of the trigger. Some people confuse the term with &ldquo;fully automatic&rdquo; firearms. (See next.) While some semi-automatic rifles may resemble military-style firearms, they are not properly classified &ldquo;Assault Weapons&rdquo; which refers to those that continue to fire until the trigger is no longer depressed.</p><h4 id=automatic>Automatic</h4><p>{{main|Automatic firearm}}
An &lsquo;&lsquo;automatic&rsquo;&rsquo; firearm, or &ldquo;fully automatic&rdquo;, &ldquo;fully auto&rdquo;, or &ldquo;full auto&rdquo;, is generally defined as one that continues to load and fire cartridges from its magazine as long as the trigger is depressed (and until the magazine is depleted of available ammunition.) The first weapon generally considered in this category is the [[Gatling gun]], originally a carriage-mounted, crank-operated firearm with multiple rotating barrels that was fielded in the [[American Civil War]]. The modern trigger-actuated machine gun began with various designs developed in the late 19th century and fielded in [[World War I]], such as the [[Maxim gun]], [[Lewis Gun]], and [[MG 08|MG 08 &ldquo;Spandau&rdquo;]]. Most automatic weapons are classed as long guns (as the ammunition used is of similar type as for rifles, and the recoil of the weapon&rsquo;s rapid fire is better controlled with two hands), but handgun-sized automatic weapons also exist, generally in the &ldquo;submachine gun&rdquo; or &ldquo;machine pistol&rdquo; class.</p><h4 id=selective-fire>Selective fire</h4><p>{{main|Selective fire}}
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;Selective fire&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;, or &ldquo;select fire&rdquo;, means the capability of a weapon&rsquo;s fire control to be adjusted in either semi-automatic, fully automatic firing modes, or 3 round burst. The modes are chosen by means of a selector, which varies depending on the weapon&rsquo;s design. Some selective-fire weapons have [[burst mode (weapons)|burst fire]] mechanisms built in to limit the maximum number of shots fired in fully automatic mode, with most common limits being two or three rounds per trigger pull. The presence of selective-fire modes on firearms allows more efficient use of ammunition for specific tactical needs, either precision-aimed or [[suppressive fire]]. This capability is most commonly found on military weapons of the 20th and 21st centuries, most notably the [[assault rifle]]s.</p></div><div class=mt-5></div></div></div></div></section></div><footer id=footer class=section-bg><div class=container><div class="row wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration=500ms><div class=col-xl-12><div class=social-icon><ul class=list-inline><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://www.facebook.com/scutum.life><i class=ti-facebook></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://twitter.com/scutum_life><i class=ti-twitter-alt></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClxTh26FwmYXXi67IXoJVJw><i class=ti-youtube></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://www.instagram.com/scutum.life/><i class=ti-instagram></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="copyright text-center"><a href=https://scutum.life/><img src=https://scutum.life/images/logo.png alt="Scutum - Lifesafety Education Center" height=42></a><br><p>Copyright © 2022, Scutum</p></div></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://scutum.life/plugins/jquery/jquery.min.js></script>
